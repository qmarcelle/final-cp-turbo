// Note: auth.config.ts is NOT typically exported from the main index 
// as it's usually imported directly by the NextAuth.js route handler.
// However, if you have a use case for exporting it, you can add:
// export { authOptions } from './auth.config';
// For now, package.json already has a specific export for ./src/auth.config
