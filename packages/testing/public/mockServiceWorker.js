 * Mock Service Worker (MSW) Service Worker File

 * This file is a placeholder for the actual mockServiceWorker.js file that 
 * would be generated by MSW using the 'msw init' command.
 *
 * In a real project, you would generate this file using:
 * npx msw init <PUBLIC_DIR> --save
 *
 * For more information on MSW setup, see:
 * https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started/integrate/browser
 *
 * This placeholder exists to prevent import errors when setting up the testing environment.
