# UI Component Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our plan for enhancing the UI component library with modern styling, improved accessibility, and better integration with React Hook Form. The goal is to create a cohesive, enterprise-grade UI component system that follows web best practices.

## Enhancement Goals

1. **Modern Styling**
   - Implement a consistent color scheme using CSS variables
   - Update components with modern visual design patterns
   - Ensure proper spacing and typography
   - Add subtle animations and transitions

2. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Add proper ARIA attributes
   - Improve keyboard navigation
   - Enhance screen reader support

3. **React Hook Form Integration**
   - Streamline form component APIs
   - Ensure type safety with TypeScript
   - Provide consistent error handling
   - Support advanced validation patterns

4. **Dark Mode Support**
   - Implement proper dark mode styling for all components
   - Ensure sufficient contrast in both light and dark modes
   - Use semantic color variables for theme switching
