# 🎨 BCBST Broker Portal Design System

Welcome to the BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee Broker Portal Design System. This comprehensive component library provides the building blocks for creating consistent, accessible, and efficient user interfaces throughout the broker portal ecosystem.

## Design Principles

Our design system is built on four core principles:

### 🎯 **Clarity First**
Every component and pattern prioritizes clear communication and ease of use for busy insurance brokers managing complex workflows.

### 📏 **Consistent Experience**
Standardized components ensure a cohesive experience across all broker portal applications and tools.

### ♿ **Accessible by Design**
All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards and support assistive technologies used by brokers with disabilities.

### 🚀 **Performance Focused**
Optimized components that load quickly and perform well on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop workstations.

## Atomic Design Structure

Our design system follows **Atomic Design methodology**, organizing components from simple to complex:

### 🧪 **Foundation**
Core design tokens and principles that define the visual language.

- **Colors** - Brand palette, status colors, and accessibility guidelines
- **Typography** - Font scales, hierarchy, and text treatments
- **Spacing** - Consistent spacing scale and layout principles
- **Shadows** - Elevation system for depth and hierarchy

### ⚛️ **Atoms**
The smallest building blocks - fundamental UI elements that can't be broken down further.

- **Button** - Primary actions, secondary actions, and interactive states
- **Input** - Text fields, form controls, and validation states
- **Select** - Dropdown menus and option selection
- **Badge** - Status indicators, counters, and labels
- **Avatar** - User profile images and fallback states

### 🧬 **Molecules**
Simple combinations of atoms that form basic UI components.

- **Card** - Content containers with headers, bodies, and actions
- **Alert** - Notifications, warnings, and status messages
- **StatBlock** - KPI displays, commission summaries, and metrics
- **SearchForm** - Member search and filtering interfaces

### 🦠 **Organisms**
Complex components built from molecules and atoms that form distinct interface sections.

- **SiteHeader** - Navigation, branding, and user account access
- **Footer** - Site-wide links, legal information, and contact details
- **QuickLinksPanel** - Dashboard shortcuts and frequently used tools
- **CommissionTable** - Data tables for commission and payment information

### 📐 **Templates**
Page-level structures that define layout and organize organisms into coherent interfaces.

- **DashboardLayout** - Main broker dashboard structure with sidebar and content areas
- **ReportingLayout** - Reporting pages with filters and data display
- **BookOfBusinessLayout** - Business analytics and group management

### 📄 **Pages**
Complete page examples that demonstrate how templates work with real content and data.

- **BrokerDashboardPage** - Complete dashboard with commission data and quick actions
- **BookOfBusinessPage** - Business reporting and analytics interface
- **ReportingOverviewPage** - Report selection and management interface
